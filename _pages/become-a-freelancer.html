    In my spare time I love to write. And having been freelancing for a few years now I decided to team up with a close friend of mine who is also a freelancer to create a pillar-page based website packed with content about how to become a freelancer, and more specifically how to get into "freelance friendly" professions. I built this site from ground-up with Jekyll.

{% include content-devices.html filename="baf-devices-1" alt="Devices view" %}

<div class='work-item__main-snippet'>

    Condensed into one word, the motivation behind the site would be "freedom" and everything that goes with it. Freedom from work in a traditional sense, being able to choose your hours, your clients, your work/life balance, how much you want to earn and where you want to live. So the site can also be described as a lifestyle blog as well as a learning resource.

  <p>
    The following is a brief outline of the design process.

{% include content-slides-fade.html images=contentslides alt="Devices view" %}

    Here you can see my look and feel exploration with images, typography, colour and layout.

{% include content-slides.html images=contentslides alt="Devices view" %}

<div class='work-item__main-snippet'>

    I developed the wireframes with a few key things in my mind. The main concern was creating a comfortable reading experience but I figured this will come through in the visual design. Navigation was something we thought a lot about, deciding to have very explicit, descriptive links in the global nav – not having things hidden in dropdowns. We also wanted contents navigation on the pillar pages, as these are likely to get very long. And have a navigation dropdown fixed when scrolling.

{% assign contentslides = "baf-slides-1.png baf-slides-2.png baf-slides-3.png baf-slides-4.png" | split: " " %}
{% include content-slides.html images=contentslides alt="Devices view" %}

<div class='work-item__main-snippet'>
  <p>
    Possibly the most important page to get right is the pillar page. It was a challenge creating a layout which accommodates the title, some metadata, introduction and contents at the top of the page. I created a few potential layouts.

</div>

{% include content-image.html filename = "baf-desktop-3.png" alt="Pillar page head" %}

{% include content-devices.html filename="baf-devices-2" alt="Devices view" %}

    The plan is to build up a collection of 'guides' for a host of different professions which are "freelancer friendly", using a pillar page structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    With each guide, we will write single articles covering more granular topics, freelancer interviews and tutorials – tageting more long-tail search terms. The articles will link back to the pillar page. The overall aim is to increase visitors, newsletter subscribers, search engine positions and become a genuinely useful resource for
