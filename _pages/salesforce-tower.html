  <p>
    CBRE needed a brand new website for the rebranded Salesforce Tower.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like most commercial property projects the main focus was the floors for let. They also wanted the website to showcase the restaurants and bars, including Sushi Samba and Duck &amp; Waffle, and the general premium nature of the building reflected in the lobby and common areas.
