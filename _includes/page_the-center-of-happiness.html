	<p>
		The Center of Happiness is a collection of articles written by the customer service professionals at Geckoboard and collaborators including Matt Dixon who is a big leader in the field.
	</p>
	<p>
		The idea is to have the guides collected in a micro-site. And to share them with customer service teams to establish Geckoboard as a thought leader in customer service.

				The first three articles in the guide talk about three stages of a customer support team development. The first is &lsquo;Firefighting&rsquo;, which is the daily battle to get on top of tickets, the second is &lsquo;Levelling up&rsquo; &mdash; where you can start to introduce innovative ways of streamlining support, the third is &lsquo;Above and Beyong&rsquo; where the team is in control and you can really take things to the next level.
			</p>
			<p>
				These three stages had to be differentiated from the advice articles in hierarchy, and had to show progression amongst themselves. I decided to use two different colourways for the two categories. And use chevrons to show progression.

				As some of the articles was pretty long, I re-used the internal navigation sidebar component that allows navigation between sections of the article.
