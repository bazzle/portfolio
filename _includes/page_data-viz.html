		<p>
			At Geckoboard, the resident data science writer, Aspasia wanted to create a campaign to help educate designers about how to present data the proper way, and the pitfalls to avoid that could misrepresent data.
		</p>
		<p>
			The campaign took the form of a poster, individual cards, social media posts and the landing page. I worked in tandem with the in-house web designer in the design and build.
		</p>
		<p>
			We commissioned talented illustrator Eve Lloyd Knight to produce the graphics.
