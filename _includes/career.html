The brands and messages had to follow through into the websites through slick visuals and interactive maps and floor plans.
			</p>
				I was involved in the design of some of the websites I worked on, but being the sole in-house developer, for most projects I was busy coding the sites which were mainly static as there was no need for regular content updates. I also worked on email marketing campaigns.

Helpful use WordPress extensively to build their sites, and through this job I gained a deep understanding of WordPress and Bootstrap.</p>
			<p>The nature of the work I did for Social Simulator could be described as unconventional. Building quick and dirty templates for German news websites, photoshopping near-apocalytic scenarios of motorway pile-ups and dam collapses aswell as a cuddly toy with acid leaking out of its battery casing. All good fun.

				On top of that, I was involved in the CSS refactoring of the project from the pure CSS to SASS using BEM. And the reworking of content from the legacy into the new template.

				One of the directors had the idea of creating a web app which provides price comparison for businesses looking for digital advertising.

				My main involvement in this interesting project was working with the product owner, back-end developer and graphic designer to translate her designs into a collection of templates and components. I was also involved in discussions around the content strategy, user journeys and the ways of incentivising businesses to pay for a premium profile. The design and development took an iterative approach throughout the design and front-end build.

				Siren is a branding agency working mainly within the property market for clients worldwide.

				The company were anxious to move on from their previous website which was nothing more than a modified WordPress theme, and did nothing to shake the negative stereotypes of badly built prefabs. They wanted a website to reflect the socially and environmentally sound modular apartments which provide affordable rentals for public sector workers and young professionals.
			</p>
			<p>
				With that in mind, and working within pretty loose constraints in terms of branding, I designed the visual language of the website &mdash; color scheme, graphical elements and content hierarchy. And designed the pages and components ready for the developer to build.
